# Surfs Up

## Overview of The Statistical Analysis:
The goal of this analysis is to create a basic statistical analysis of the temperatures on Oahu during the months of June and December. This is to help determine whether or not the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. By creating a query that captures the temperatures specifically for the months of June and December, we can retrieve information such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.

## Results:
### June Temperatures:
Based on the analysis, we can see that there are 1,700 observations for the months of June. The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures are listed below. The low standard deviation implies a relatively small spread across the temperature observations. This makes sense, as Oahu weather does not seem to fluctuate significantly.

### December Temperatures:
December has 1,517 observations. From the charts, we can see that June and December are close in average, maximum, and minimum temperature. More importantly, the results are about the same as the for the month of June.

## Summary:
By comparing the statistic summary of the two months, we can conclude that temperature patterns remain steady throughout the whole year. However, there are two more queries that we need to include to get a better understanding of the weather on Oahu. Although temperatures may remain about the same throughout the year, precipitation may not and would also have a significant impact of the business's sustainability. Doing a statistically summary of the precipitation patterns during the months of June and December will give us a better picture of the overall weather pattern. But for now it looks like it time to sell fome board wax and ice cream!
